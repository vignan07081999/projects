### Introduction
The project is designed to demonstrate detection of any object ahead of the ultrasonic sensor. It can be used for applications like security area monitoring and wild life photography etc. This ultrasonic detector consists of two parts: an emitter, which produces a 40 kHz sound wave; and a detector, which detects this 40 kHz sound wave and sends the signal back to the microcontroller. The ultrasonic module is interfaced to the microcontroller of 8051 family. Whenever any object approaches near the ultrasonic module, the signal transmitted the transmitter is reflected by this object and is received by the module. When the microcontroller receives the signal from ultrasonic receiver it actuates the output to take the appropriate action. An LCD or buzzer is interfaced to the microcontroller for detecting the status of the module like whether the object is detected or not. Further the project can be enhanced by interfacing a GSM modem to the project so that, when the object is detected then the controller sends an SMS to the user.

### Arduino Code

### Applications
Ideal for sensing clear objects and diffuse sensing of targets at long ranges, such as automobile windshields
Detects full or empty positions in stack height control applications
Senses position of the material loops the roller speed can be adjusted as required for non-contact web loop control
Detects roll diameters to determine when the material will run out; or for stamping applications where shiny metal surfaces can be challenging to detect with photoelectric sensors
Well suited for level applications with liquids and materials with uneven surfaces such as granules and powders
